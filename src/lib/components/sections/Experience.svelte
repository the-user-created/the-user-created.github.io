			<h3 class="mb-0">Intern Netrunner</h3>
			<div class="subheading mb-3">Arixian</div>
			<p>
				Arixian is a tech startup spinning up AI-driven security solutions that detect and deter intruders in
				real-time. Think of them as a digital tripwire for the 21st century.
			</p>
			<p>During my gig at Arixian, I was tasked with building a microservice for secure optic-data streaming. My
				responsibilities included:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Coding microservices using Python.</li>
				<li>Hardening secure communication protocols against intrusion.</li>
				<li>Containerizing the works with Docker.</li>
				<li>Collaborating with the crew to boost system security and performance.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The job was to shunt encrypted video data from cameras to the cloud, ensuring it was locked down tighter than
				a corpo vault. My work at Arixian was a preem score, giving me valuable XP in building secure, scalable systems
				and a look into the real-world combat zone of digital security.

			<h3 class="mb-0">iOS App Developer</h3>
			<div class="subheading mb-3">Oobalink</div>
			<p>
				Oobalink is a fixer under the ooba Group, a major loan originator in the South African sector, running a
				network of franchisees.
			</p>
			<p>My contract was to build an iOS prototype for streamlining client data acquisition—a fully interactive demo of
				the final product, no net-link required. Responsibilities:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Designing and implementing the UI with SwiftUI.</li>
				<li>Building interactive data-entry forms and fields.</li>
				<li>Managing local data flow and state within the app's memory.</li>
				<li>Implementing on-device data storage solutions.</li>
				<li>Configuring local notifications to ping the user.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				This prototype served as a proof-of-concept for the suits, letting them experience the proposed functions
				firsthand without the risk of a live system. A solid gig in UX design and running ops off-the-grid.
