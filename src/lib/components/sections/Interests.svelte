	<h2 class="mb-5">Downtime // Off-the-Clock</h2>
	<p class="mb-4">
		You'll find me jacked in, where the Net is stable and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. My interests include new
		tech, gaming, and convincing my cats that I am a worthy meat-servant.
	</p>
	<h3 class="mb-2">Gaming: Where Most of My Downtime Goes</h3>
	<p class="mb-4">
		With almost 3,000 hours in <i>League of Legends</i>, I’ve experienced the full spectrum of human emotions—mostly
		regret. I enjoy competitive sims that challenge my strategic implants (and patience).
	</p>
	<h3 class="mb-2">Ghost Projects & Code Sprints</h3>
	<p class="mb-4">
		I love spinning up new programming projects. Finishing them? Not so much. I'll get a spark of inspiration, dive
		into the code, and then, somewhere around the halfway mark, a new, shinier idea will appear. It’s a cycle, but it
		keeps the skills sharp.
	</p>
	<h3 class="mb-2">Paranoia as a Protocol</h3>
	<p class="mb-4">
		I take digital security seriously—partly because it fascinates me and partly because I don’t trust the Net. I
		enjoy keeping up with the latest ICE-breaking trends and making sure my data is locked down tighter than a Militech
		vault.
	</p>
	<h3 class="mb-2">Feline Companions: The Perfect Operatives</h3>
	<p class="mb-4">I like cats. They don’t ask too many questions, respect personal space, and judge you silently—qualities I deeply admire.</p>
