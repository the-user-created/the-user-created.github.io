		Yo, choom! I'm hardwired for rapid data acquisition—a useful trait when the Street throws new data your way. I
		assimilate new skillchips fast, and thanks to some high-spec cognitive implants (<i>my op planning is flawless</i>),
		I actually execute. Plotting a run? Love it. Bypassing corporate ICE? Sign me up. Finding a backdoor when the front
		gate is sealed? That's my jam.

	<p class="lead mb-5">
		I was self-programmed since day one (aka homeschooled), meaning I mastered self-discipline and managing the clock
		before most gonks figured out their morning alarms. Deadlines don't spook me—they're just another variable in the
		equation. I can navigate corpo hierarchies, too. I know when to follow the script and when to ask, "But what if
		we tried a different route?"
	</p>
	<p class="lead mb-5">
		Basically, I’m always learning, always upgrading, and always ready to jack into a new challenge. Let's build
		something nova.
