		pageTitle: 'DATA SHARD: FERS Modernization',
		title: 'Modernising the FERS Software Package',
		github: 'https://github.com/the-user-created/FERS',
		overview: `This project focused on updating the Flexible, Extensible Radar Simulator (FERS) to meet modern C++ standards (C++20/23). Originally developed in C++98/03, FERS is a vital tool in radar simulation for the Radar and Remote Sensing Group (RRSG) at UCT. The modernisation enhanced FERS's performance, readability, maintainability, and future extensibility, making it compatible with modern development environments while retaining core functionality.`,
		objectives: [
			'Upgrade the FERS codebase to incorporate C++20/23 features, improving readability, maintainability, and efficiency.',
			'Implement performance optimisations, including multithreading and improved memory management, for faster, more efficient radar simulations.',
			'Ensure backward compatibility to maintain the integrity and accuracy of simulation results.',
			'Develop and conduct thorough testing to validate the modernised softwareâ€™s functionality and performance improvements.'

		],
		otherTech: 'HighFive (HDF5), libxml2, Understand by SciTools, Doxygen.',
		details: `The modernisation process was approached incrementally, starting with an analysis of the FERS codebase to identify areas for improvement. Key upgrades included replacing manual memory management with smart pointers, implementing lambda expressions and C++-style casts, and applying advanced C++20/23 features like concepts, ranges, and modules. The project also involved optimising performance through multithreading and algorithmic improvements. Tools like Valgrind and perf were used for profiling and validation, while Doxygen was employed to generate inline documentation for maintainability.`,
		challenges: `The primary challenges included ensuring backward compatibility, managing the complexities introduced by modern C++ features, and mitigating the risk of introducing errors during extensive refactoring. Through a careful, incremental approach and the use of robust testing tools, these challenges were systematically addressed. Regression testing, CI with GitHub Actions, and performance profiling were key in overcoming these obstacles.`,
		results: `The modernized FERS software demonstrated improved performance, with speedups ranging from 1.46x to 3.55x across different test cases. All memory leaks were eliminated, and memory management was optimised with smart pointers. Regression testing achieved 90.5% line coverage, and function coverage reached 95.8%, ensuring high reliability.`,

		overview: `This project explores the performance and efficiency of MD5 and MD6 hashing algorithm implementations across different programming languages and hardware: C++, OpenCL, and Verilog. The focus is on evaluating execution time and throughput to identify the best implementation strategy for various computational contexts.`,

		otherTech: 'Hardware/Software: Xilinx Vivado Design Suite.',
		details: `The project involves implementing the MD5 and MD6 hashing algorithms in different environments to compare their performance. The MD5 algorithm, being inherently sequential, presents challenges for parallelization. However, the MD6 algorithm, designed with parallelization in mind, is evaluated for its efficiency on multicore processors and parallel computing platforms. The implementations include a sequential MD5 in C++, an OpenCL MD5 to test parallel capabilities, and a Verilog MD5 for hardware acceleration. The MD6 algorithm is implemented sequentially and in parallel using C++ to demonstrate the benefits of parallel processing.`,
		challenges: `One of the primary challenges faced was the sequential nature of the MD5 algorithm, which limited its potential for parallelization. Implementing MD5 in OpenCL highlighted performance bottlenecks, particularly in kernel execution and data transfer. Additionally, the Verilog implementation was constrained by the maximum input size it could handle, limiting its practical applicability.`,
		results: `The project successfully demonstrated the performance differences across various implementations. The parallelized C++ MD6 implementation achieved significant speedup, making it the most efficient for handling large data volumes. The Verilog MD5 implementation, though extremely fast for small inputs, was limited by its maximum input size constraint. The OpenCL MD5 implementation faced performance issues, highlighting the need for further optimization.`,
